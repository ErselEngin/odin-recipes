    </div><br><br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Nut Mixture:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups walnut halves</li>
        <li>1 cup shelled pistachios</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>12 sheets phyllo dough, thawed if frozen</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Syrup:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups sugar</li>

        <li>¾ cup water</li>

        <li>¼ cup honey</li>

        <li>3 whole cloves</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1 ½ teaspoons orange flower water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place walnuts, pistachios, and cinnamon in bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until mixture is chopped but not too fine.</li>
        <li>Brush bottom of 9-inch round baking pan with melted butter. Place one round of phyllo dough in the pan; add a second round of dough. Drip about 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top. Add 2 more sheets and drizzle with butter. Add 2 more sheets and drip with butter creating 6 layers for the bottom. (While you work keep the phyllo sheets covered with a damp, nearly dry, cotton towel to keep dough from drying out.)</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with 1/3 of the nut mixture. Top with a sheet of phyllo and drip with melted butter; repeat with 1 more sheet of filo. Add another 1/3 of the nut mixture.</li>
        <li>Place another sheet of phyllo on the nuts; drip with butter. Top with another sheet and drip with butter. Add the remaining nut mixture.</li>
        <li>Top with 2 sheets of phyllo; drip with butter. Add 2 more sheets; drip with butter. Top with the last 2 sheets and drizzle generously with the remaining butter. Cover pan with plastic and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut baklava into about 12 diamond-shaped pieces approximately the same size.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned and crisp, about an hour.</li>
        <li>Place sugar, honey, and cloves in a saucepan. Pour in water. Place pan over medium-high heat and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil; remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla and orange blossom water.</li>
        <li>After baklava has rested 5 minutes, ladle syrup over the top. Cool down to room temperature before serving. </li>
    </ol>
